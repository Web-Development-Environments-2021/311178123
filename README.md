## Project overview

---

The project is about creating a website for a family member.
The person presented in the website is my mom - __Miri Yavin__

Link to the website:

https://web-development-environments-2021.github.io/311178123/

### You can:
    * Like or share the website using the like & share button
    * Share the QR code with friends so they can visit the website
    * Contact me via the contact form and let me know what you think.


## Special Remark:
---

The email system is using a third party software called FormSubmit.io. To send an email you should:

    1. Fill the contact form and press "Submit form", for example:

     2. A seperate tab will open. After you have checked the box your form should have been sent to the email configured in the website.

         You can check your email to see the message:

## Installation instructions
---

For using the website no special installtions are required.
You can just visit the website.
There is though, a special action you will need to do in order to change the target email of
the contact form, meaning the email that the messege will be **sent to**.
The email system I chose to use is a third party system called __FormSubmit.io__. For more
information about the system please refer to:
https://formsubmit.co/?utm_source=formsubmit.co&utm_medium=site%20link&utm_campaign=submission%20page

In order to change the target email you will have to:

    1. Replace the email written in line 319 in index.html:

    2. Upon trying to send the first email using the contact form an email from FormSubmit will send to you to activate the service:

         ![‏‏לכידה](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/64005996/112661582-bbe42980-8e67-11eb-8337-8ee952829bf8.PNG)

        After clicking the "Activate Link" you can start sending emails with ease.

## Common bugs:
---

There are some known issues:

   - As you saw in the first picture in __Special Remarks__, after you have sent the message there will be a link for going back to the website
      
      [
      ![‏‏לכידה](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/64005996/112675204-e8a03d00-8e77-11eb-8d37-448ea619b664.PNG)
      ](url)

   As you can see this is not full URL to the webiste so the link will not work. This is a known bug in the service so don't click the link and just close the tab
   If it was open in a new tab (like in the first picture in special remarks) or go backward with the arrow button.
